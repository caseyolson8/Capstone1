# Local Climate Trends: What is changing where?

The earth's temperature is rising an average of 0.32 $^\circ$F per decade since 1981 [[1]](#1).  What are the trends where I live:  Are Denver summers actually getting hotter or drier and winters less snowy?  What are the trends in other regions, how concerned should they be?

## The Dataset
Using longitudinal (daily) weather recordings spanning the past 70 years from select weather stations across the United States I will attempt to answer these questions.  Data is available from the GHCN weather resource.  blah blah blah

## Questions
1. Using daily weather data from the previous 70 years calculate if average weather statistics are trending significantly from historical distributions
    - H0:
    - HA:    
2. Compare any trends between different locations across the United States
    - H0:
    - HA:
## Methods/Statistical Analyses
Work in Progress

## Results
Show the images of yearly averaged data, maybe for one city?

Show the stats in a table
Show the images of seasonal (winter & summer) averaged data
Show the stats in a table
Show the rates as per decade

How can we evaluate the difference in slopes from 2 different cities?
- plot the confidence intervals for all cities in a 

## Discussion
Explain the meaning of the slope, the CI bounds, and the prediction bounds.
