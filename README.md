# Local Climate Trends: What is changing where?

The earth's temperature is rising an average of 0.32 $^\circ$F per decade since 1981 [[1]](#1).  What are the trends where I live:  Are Denver summers actually getting hotter or drier and winters less snowy?  What are the trends in other regions?

## The Dataset
Daily weather records from the past 70 years were collected from the GHCN (Global Historical Climatology Network) taken from selected weather stations in Denver, Seattle, Boston, and Baton Rouge. These datasets provide fairly reliable daily recordings of the high & low temperatures ```TMAX``` and ```TMIN``` in $^\circ$F, the precipitation ```PRCP``` in inches, and new snowfall ```SNOW``` in inches.

## Questions
1. Using daily weather data from the previous 70 years calculate if average weather statistics are trending significantly from historical distributions
    - H0:
    - HA:    
2. Compare any trends between different locations across the United States
    - H0:
    - HA:

How can we evaluate the difference in slopes from 2 different cities?
- plot the confidence intervals for all cities in a 

## Discussion
Explain the meaning of the slope, the CI bounds, and the prediction bounds.
