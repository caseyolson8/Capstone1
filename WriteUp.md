# Nice weather for October! maybe too nice...

The earth's temperature is rising an average of 0.32 $^\circ$F per decade since 1981 [[1]](#1), driving glacial melting and rising sea levels.  But what is actually happening where I live:  Are Denver summers actually getting hotter or drier and winters less snowy?  Surprisingly in many other regions of the United States global warming is of much less concern, do regional trends across the US vary significantly?

## The Dataset
Using longitudinal (daily) weather recordings spanning the past 70 years from select weather stations across the United States I will attempt to answer these questions.  Data is available from the GHCN weather resource.  blah blah blah

## Questions
1. Using daily weather data from the previous 70 years calculate if average weather statistics are trending significantly from historical distributions
    - H0:
    - HA:    
2. Compare any trends between different locations across the United States
    - H0:
    - HA:
## Methods/Statistical Analyses
Work in Progress

## Results
Show the images of yearly averaged data, maybe for one city?
Show the stats in a table
Show the images of seasonal (winter & summer) averaged data
Show the stats in a table
Show the rates as per decade

How can we evaluate the difference in slopes from 2 different cities?
- plot the confidence intervals for all cities in a 

## Discussion
Explain the meaning of the slope, the CI bounds, and the prediction bounds.
